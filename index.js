// Write your code here

// Equation whose multiplied results will equal 62
let num1 = 1;
let num2 = 62;
let multiply = num1*num2;

// Generates a random integer greater than 0
let random = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);

// Is an equation that calculates a remainder that it's equal to 4
let num3 = 13;
let num4 = 9;
let mod = num3%num4;

// Will return 20 as the highest number in the set
let max = Math.max(10, 15, 3, 20);
